# News Site. The project is made when doing Technigo bootcamp.

This project was about creating a News site that should contain a header with a name, logo and navbar. It should also contain one section with big news and a grid of other news. The assignment is about learning box-model, flexbox and responsive design.

## The problem

I started to plan on how I would approach the project by writing down the tasks required to fulfill the blue level. I wrote them on post-it notes and my plan was to make sure I finished each of the requirements step by step so I would understand what I was doing along the way. Then I started with the html structure but instead of finishing every task as I had decided too I started to style some parts in CSS and then added some flexbox and after a while I wasn’t sure of what I was doing at all. So I deleted everything and started over again by cloning the project from Github. When I started over I struggled a lot with flexbox so I went through the recorded lectures on canvas again and searched for flexbox questions in stackoverflow. I also tried out flexbox froggy which helped me a lot to understand the vertical and horizontal axis in flexbox and how to place flexbox-items in flexbox containers. When starting over again, I began to comment away css declaration blocks when I wanted to implement flexbox to see if a specific declaration made any difference and in what way. That was very helpful to get to understand the code and what it actually did. When I started with the media queries I had problems with getting the right amount of cards in rows/columns in the different devices, even though I sat with the recorded lecture of responsive design side by side with VScode and tried to code along. Since I couldn’t figure it out by myself I asked a team member for help so we went through the code together which was very helpful. In the end he helped me solve the problem and I also had to explain how I was thinking about the solution so I would know that I had understood how we got the right result in the end. Another great way to better understand the code was to look at threads in our team on Slack where some of us shared their code and other teamebers helped to solve their code problems.

If I had more time I would like to start over one more time just to practice more on flexbox and the responsive design. I would also like to fix the title for the big news section so it will “follow” the position of the picture in all different sizes. Maybe I would have added a different layout for the big desktop size as well.
